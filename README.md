# belly-button-challenge

In this project, an interactive dashboard is created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard includes a bar chart displaying the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) for a selected individual, a bubble chart visualizing all species in the sample, and a metadata panel that shows demographic information. 

The dashboard updates dynamically when a user selects a new sample from a dropdown menu.
